#BuzzWords For Git

* What is Git ?
  ____________

-> Distributed VCS (Virsion Control system).
  
   #Version Control : database that let you have snaps of your works at any time.

   #Repository      : kind of db that stores all versions  and metadata of Project 
                      (.git folder in root directory of Project) 

   #Working Copy    : Root Folder of Project is called WC. 

  
* local & Remote Repo : 
  ____________________
  
  local - .git folder on your local machine
 
  remote - .git folder on one server (i.e Github) use to share versions between project's Users.


* Types of Files in Git :
  ______________________

  1) untracked : files not under VCS   ( not watch for change to such files )

  2) tracked   : files under VCS       ( watch for changes so as to allow or discard )  


* Commit & Staging : 
  ________________

  -> save new image of project : ( 2 steps ) 

     1. Staging : decide which local changes of track files to proceed in next commit.

     2. commit :  Wraps up image of project at particular time that includes changes invloved in staging.

* Branch :
  ________

  -> master branch is created automatically when we start the project.

  -> currently active or HEAD branch is addressed by * (asterisk)

  Types of branches : 

  1. Short-lived/Topic branches  : ( for new feature or bugfix)

  2. long-running branches 

 
REMEMBER : keep local and remote branch in sync i.e same naming convention at both side.


* Save Changes Temporarily (stashing) :
  _________________________

  -> get changes save temporary and have a clean working copy for another work.

  -> take all changes from working copy and save them on clipboard. & there are no more local changes left out.

     Later You can restore those changes at any time. 


     Applying stash : newest stash will always at the top of list.


* Merge Changes :
  ______________

  The target of such merging or integration is always current HEAD branch/Working Copy

  2 step process : ( locally ) 

     1. Check out the branch that should receive the changes.

     2. Call the "git merge" command with the name of the branch that contains the desired changes.

  Merge Conflicts : 
  ----------------
    In some cases on merging, 'merge conflicts' will be resulted.

  merge commit : combine changes of two branch that needed to be merged into new, seperate commit called as merge commit.
  ------------


* Remote Repositories : 
  ____________________

  -> diff between local & remote repository :

     - working directory ( where some versions of project is checkout for you to work ) is not present in remote repo.

  -> only means for sharing & exchanging codes between developers.

  => Creating Remote Repo :
     ---------------------
  
     - 1. alreday have local repo and if you want to base it on as remote repo. ( with --bare option) 

       2. create blank remote repo ( with --bare option ) 

     
     Q What is bare Git Repository ?

     ->  There are 2 commands i.e git init & git init --bare.

        git init : The directory in which you do this will be become the Working Tree for the repository.
               
                   git creates a .git directory ( brain of the repository ). its where Git tracks changes, commits,
                   
                   refs, etc.


        git init --bare : repository that is created without Working Tree
 
                          its content is same as typically content present in .git repository ( created using git init command)

                          it is typically used as remote repository

                   

* Connecting Remote Repo : 
  ______________________

  1) when clone from remote repo : git save this connection as remote called "origin" by default

  2) But if you started with fresh local copy ( & its versioning locally ) , manually need to connect to new remote 
 
     inorder to have remote interactions.


  Getting Remote Snap : 
  --------------------

  -> tell explicitly to get update from remote  ( for that fetch command is used ) 

     Fetch : It will just download data from remote & not change any of local branch .


  Once Connected, you want to work on remote branch.

  To work on remote branch , you must create local branch that's based on this remote branch .
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   -> for that you need to checkout the remote branch :

      checkout : to have same branch name as remote and also to point head to this new local branch created from remote.

      track : to keep track with remote branch so as to inform either one of branch consist commit that another doesn't have.

      
  Sharing Changes with Server : 
  ---------------------------

  - git push : 
    _________

    -> commits all new commits from head branch ( local ) to its remote CounterPart branch.
    
    -> It requires 2 specification ( if not tracked ) : remote repo & branch on remote repo


  - git pull : 
    _________

    -> Integrates changes from remote server to local branch or working copy

    -> It requires 2 specification ( if not tracked ) : remote repo & branch on remote repo 


* Publishing a local branch : 
  __________________________

  To share branch created on your local machine to remote. i.e to push that branch on remote  


* Fixing the very last commit :
  ___________________________

  --amend flag of git commit command

  You can 1. correct last commit message.   ( without staging latest changes )
 
          2. add some more changes to the last commit.   


* Undo to Previous Changes : 
  ___________________________

  -> undoing local changes : undoing changes that haven't been yet committed

  -> undoing committed changes : 
 
     1. git revert 

     2. git reset : neither produce new commit nor it delete old ones. 

                    It reset current HEAD branch to Older version


  NOTE : Both commands, revert and reset, only affect your current HEAD branch.


*  Dealing with Merge Conflicts :
   _____________________________

   -> Arise when 

      Change in same line in same file took place

       - delete of file from one user and modification of file by another

       - both add a file with same name

   -> Use dedicated merge tool in case of conflict


   Undo a merge : 
   _____________

   -> git merge --abort

      git reset --hard


* Merge Commits :
  ________________

  -> Its get created automatically by git

  -> its purpose is to connect 2 branches, just as knot


* Rebasing : 
  _________
 
  -> looks like development happened in straight line because merge commit works as if it was linear development betn 2 branch
 
  => Merge Several commits into one 
     _____________________________
     
     -> interactive rebase - git rebase -i
 
* Relative Ref & Moving :
  ____________________
  
  ->   Moving upwards one commit at a time with ^
       Moving upwards a number of times with ~<num>
       
       You can use branch or HEAD as a Relative ref

  -> Move Branches Around : reassign branch to a commit with -f option i.e git branch -f master HEAD~3
